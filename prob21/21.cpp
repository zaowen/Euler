/*
Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).
If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.

Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.

//Function countdiv( double n)
/*
Arguments:
	double n: The number you want to calculate the sum of its divisors less 
		than n
Functionality:
	Checks for divisors up to and including n^.5 +1 because my pal shawn told 
	me that works, and if they are less than n it adds them to beaver because
	its almost 7am i haven't slept yet and beavers are funny.
Returns:
	The sum of the divisors of n, not including n.
Bugs:
	1. May crash for negative values of n.
